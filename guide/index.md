# K-Platform client

It is a fully customisable and easily extensible administrative panel for managing a platform-based system [@k-platform](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-core). To start working with the client, you can deploy the example admin application following the example in the [readme.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/master/README.md) file.

The following describes some modules, services and utilities on which the application is based. For information about other parts of the admin-panel, see the [codebase documentations website](https://alexander-kiriliuk.github.io/k-platform-client).

## Embedded modules

- ### [Explorer](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/components/explorer)

  This module provides rendering of CRUD, pagination and search UI of all entities in the system, which is automatically created based on meta-data of objects in the database. Metadata is also generated automatically as a result of the [database analyzer](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-core/tree/master/lib/common/explorer). But you can change the appearance and behaviour of UI elements by customising system objects rendering parameters, or by creating your own renderers. 
    
  #### Common components:
  - Explorer section - is a universal component that provides the ability to page, search and filter records any entities of database. Each column is displayed using the section renderer bound to it.
  - Explorer object - is a universal component that provides the ability to perform CRUD operations on any entity. Each column is displayed with the help of the object renderer bound to it.
  - [Explorer renderer](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/guide/explorer/explorer-renderer.md) - special components that are bound to entity columns, responsible for the appearance and behaviour logic of editing elements and displaying entity fields. There is also a separate type of renderer `action-renderer`, which is responsible for the display and logic of entity action elements.

- ### [Object](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/components/object)

  This module is responsible for displaying all database entities. It allows you to edit the metadata of all entity columns, manage renderers, create virtual columns, manage read and edit access by users roles, adjust the display order and customise the tabbed UI for editing an entity. You can [read more here](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/guide/object/object.md).

- ### [Auth](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/components/auth)
  This module provides an authorisation form and two types of captcha: normal and google recaptcha. Read more about [captcha](https://alexander-kiriliuk.github.io/k-platform-core/additional-documentation/properties/captcha.properties.html), [authorisation](https://alexander-kiriliuk.github.io/k-platform-core/additional-documentation/properties/auth.properties.html) and [bruteforce](https://alexander-kiriliuk.github.io/k-platform-core/additional-documentation/properties/bruteforce.properties.html) protection settings.

- ### [Config](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/components/config)
  UI module for [configuration](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-core/blob/master/guide/config.md) of application. Allows real-time control of application settings, default data is stored in redis, initial settings are read from `.properties` files.

- ### [Profile](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/components/profile)
  This UI is designed to manage the current user's data.

- ### [XDB](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/components/xdb)
  This UI for working with [XML data-bridge](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-core/blob/master/guide/xml-data-bridge.md). It allows you to import xml-schema or configuration file as zip-archive.

## Embedded UI components

- ### [FileInputComponent](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/modules/file)
  Displays a list of files, tied to entities fields with type `File`. Supports working with lists of files. Allows files to be downloaded from the user's device or selected from previously downloaded files.

- ### [MediaComponent](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/modules/media)
  The component displays images, tied to entities with type `Media`.

- ### [MediaInputComponent](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/modules/media/src/input)
  Displays a list of medias, tied to entities fields with type `Media`. Supports working with lists of images. Allows images to be downloaded from the user's device or selected from previously downloaded.

- ### [RefInputComponent](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/modules/ref-input)
  Allows any entity to be used as a reference, i.e. if a field of one entity refers to another (or many others, there is support for working with lists), then this component provides a UI to make this connection.

- ### [LocalizeStringInputComponent](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/modules/locale/src/string-input)
  An internationalised input field that handles string values for different locales.

- ### [LocalizeMediaInputComponent](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/modules/locale/src/media-input)
  An internationalised media-input that handles string values for different locales.

- ### [PreloaderComponent](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/modules/preloader)
  The component displaying the loading animation is tied to the use of its own [directive](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/modules/preloader/src/preloader.directive.ts). It is controlled with [`Store`](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/modules/store) commands.

## Common embedded services and utilities

- ### [CurrentUser](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/global/service/user/current-user.ts)
  This is a singleton-class that stores data about the current user in the system and some settings from the configuration. Has some methods to manage on user data.

- ### [Store](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/modules/store)
  It is a global event bus that allows sending and subscribing to messages. It allows to implement event-driven architecture in an application.

- ### [Device](https://github.com/alexander-kiriliuk/k-platform-client/tree/master/lib/src/modules/device)
  This is a singleton-class that stores information about the client based on user-agent. It has several methods for determining client parameters. It is based on the `ngx-device-detector` package.
